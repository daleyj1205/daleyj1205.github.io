## Past Projects

### A Spatial Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk
This was a project that I conducted for my class: Introduction to Machine Learning for Physical Sciences. I predicted CVD risk as measured by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment using several variables, all from the California Environmental Screening 4.0 dataset.

## Career Aspirations and Resume
In my career, I aim to futher pursue my interests in remote sensing and geospatial science. Throughout my time as an undergraduate at UCLA, I have gained a deep understanding of spatial data analysis techniques. From courses ranging from UAV Field Methods in Geography to Computer Science in C++, I have explored the entire lifecycle of geospatial data, from primary source capture to web application implementation. In the future, I imagine myself utilizing the latest and greatest satellite technology, machine learning models, and geospatial technology to analyze complex social-environmental problems to inform decising making.
