### Hi there, I'm Jack!

I am an avid geospatial analyst excited to delve into this fascinating field.

Here you will find information about past projects that I have conducted, my career aspirations, and some personal stories.

I would love to connect on [LinkedIn!](www.linkedin.com/in/jack-daley-0b96a022b)


### Past Projects

## A Spatial Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk
This was a project that I conducted for my class: Introduction to Machine Learning for Physical Sciences. I predicted CVD risk as measured by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment using several variables, all from the California Environmental Screening 4.0 dataset.

### Dataset

A link to the dataset you used must be submitted on BruinLearn so that your course instructor can use it to run your code. To do this, it might be easiest to upload the dataset to Google Drive, then share a link (click *Share* then *Copy link*). If your dataset is too big to upload, try to find a way to reduce its size, or speak with your instructor if this is not possible.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download and run your code using the dataset. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
